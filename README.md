# HPC
High-performance calculations  with some parallel algorithms based on openmp and mpi by C/C++


# openmp

there are basic parallel algorithms like scan algorithms,parallel for random methods,sort algorithms,independent sets and so on.
the codes may not be the most efficient but right at least run on big data.

# mpi
with usage of basic mpi,mainly included matrix multiplication algorithms and system of linear equations,they can run on Single-machine and multi-machine.

# references

some articles and datum I've collected when studying and coding which maybe helpful to understand the algorithms.
